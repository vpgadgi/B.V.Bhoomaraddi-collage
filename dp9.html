            <h2>About Department</h2>
            <p>
                Every journey invariably starts with a single step and the journey to scale great heights needs unflinching grit and relentless efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the same determination, we had embarked on a journey in 1980 by setting up the Commerce department to facilitate commerce education at UG level with core subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department ablaze, constantly striving to offer relevant and updated courses with practical dimensions to provide a dynamic business environment with equipped personnel. The department has adequately well-qualified, competent faculty who are dedicated to the academic & overall development of the student.
            </p>
            <p>
                The teaching highlights of the faculty of our department are learner-centric, ICT-enabled, project-based, continuous assessment, and compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                We cultivate in students an uncompromising commitment towards enhancing the quality of life both at the organizational and societal level & also fostering a passionate pursuit of academic & intellectual excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, education is not just the dissemination of knowledge but equipping the students with appropriate skills & the ability to take up new challenges for contributing to society as well as fulfilling their career dreams.
